# Ferrimagnet

Here we model the behaviour of a ferrimagnet. The approach follows that outlined in chapt. 3 of Spin Waves: Theory and Applicatons by D. D. Stancil. The magnetization of the two sublattices is contained in the two coupled non-linear equatons, given in the notes package. The python scripts in this repository give interactive plots of the solutions of these equations, with varying degrees of approximation.

See the images folder for screenshots of the implemented widgets. Note that you will need to download lab.mplstyle from the resources folder, or comment out the line plt.style.use('lab') in the widget code.
